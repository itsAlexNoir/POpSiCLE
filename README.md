# POpSiCLE

**POpSiCLE** stands for *PhOtoelectron SpeCtrum library for Laser-matter intEractions*, and it is a
library that allows the calculation of photoelectron spectra for various
grid-based solutions of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation
(and time-dependent Kohn Sham equations of *TDDFT*). Methods implemented include
**Fourier transform methods**, **Hankel transforms**, the **surface flux method**
(*tSURFF*) and the **sampling point method**. It works from a variety of
highly-parallelised codes.
