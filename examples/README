The data is provided separately due to its size (around 60 Mb), and because it
is not necessary for building and running the library.
The data will be automatically downloaded if needed (you will be asked if you
want to do so), otherwise the data can be manually download from the following url:

http://titus.phy.qub.ac.uk/members/alex/popsicle_data.tar.gz

If you wish to download the data from the command line, you only have to copy
and paste the following line in the command line:

wget http://titus.phy.qub.ac.uk/members/alex/popsicle_data.tar.gz
